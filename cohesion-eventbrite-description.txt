Are you building something to bring people together? Whether it's a digital platform, neighborhood initiative, community space, or innovative gathering format‚Äîthis summit is designed to help you find mission-aligned collaborators who share your vision.

THE EXPERIENCE:

üïê 6:00 PM - Speed Pitching Icebreakers
Rotate through small groups where everyone gets one minute to share their project, idea, or vision. It's fast-paced, fun, and helps you refine your message while discovering potential synergies.

üï¢ 6:45 PM - Team Formation  
Write your idea on a sign and find 3-9 others who share your passion. Teams form organically around the most compelling visions and complementary skills.

üïí 7:15 PM - Public Pitches & Connection Time
Each team presents their vision to the full summit. After pitches, connect directly with the teams whose ideas inspired you most.

This isn't just another networking event‚Äîit's a structured experience designed to help solo visions become shared missions. When mission-aligned people work together, we create something far greater than the sum of our parts.
