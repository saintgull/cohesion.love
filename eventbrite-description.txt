COHESION SUMMIT #1 - EVENT DESCRIPTION FOR EVENTBRITE

=== SHORT DESCRIPTION ===
An evening where Toronto's community builders come together to find collaborators. Practice your pitch, form teams, and leave with partners for your project. Limited to 225 people.

=== FULL DESCRIPTION ===
Join us for an evening designed to connect Toronto's community builders, organizers, and dreamers who are working to bring people together.

**THE PHILOSOPHY:**
We believe that when mission-aligned people work together, 3 people can achieve more than 3 people working separately. This summit is about finding that alignment and turning individual dreams into collective action.

Whether you're building a digital platform, organizing neighborhood events, creating community spaces, or dreaming up new ways to foster human connection, this summit is your chance to find mission-aligned collaborators.

**THE FORMAT:**

**6:00 PM - Speed-Meeting Icebreakers**
Get sorted into small groups where everyone has one minute to share their idea, dream, project, or values. Rotate through multiple groups to practice your pitch and hear diverse perspectives.

**6:45 PM - Team Formation**
Write your idea on a sign and find others with complementary visions. Form teams of 4-10 people around shared interests and goals.

**7:15 PM - Pitches & Connection**
Teams pitch their collaborative visions to the whole room. After pitches, freely connect with people whose ideas excite you most.

**WHAT TO BRING:**
- Your idea (no matter how rough!)
- Openness to collaboration
- Contact info to share

**WHO SHOULD COME:**
- Community organizers and event creators
- Tech builders focused on human connection
- Neighborhood activists and local leaders
- Those seeking collaborators for community projects
- Anyone with ideas for bringing people together

Come with your idea. Leave with a team.
