## Themes and Connections

### Upper Right Cluster (Systems & Work)
- **"Robust interdisciplinary social networks"** → Building connections across different fields, backgrounds, and expertise areas
- **"Building takes energy"** → Recognition that community-building requires intentional energy investment and sustained effort
- **"4 day work week"** → Alternative work arrangements that could create more time and space for community engagement

### Center Cluster (Types of Relationships)
- **"Abundance of love"** → Creating cultures that prioritize care, support, and emotional wealth
- **"How do we show abundance"** → Making visible the resources, care, and wealth that already exist in communities
- **"Making more visible and acknowledge acts of care"** → Recognition and celebration of the caring work people already do
- **"Non-event based connection"** → Building relationships through daily life, shared activities, and ongoing interaction
- **"Relationship makes cohesion"** → Understanding that strong community bonds are built through quality connections

### Types of Events Cluster
- **"More neighborhood focused events"** → Programming that brings immediate neighbors together
- **"After hours events that are not alcohol focused"** → Creating diverse social opportunities beyond bar/drinking culture
- **"More intergenerational socializing"** → Bringing different age groups together for mutual learning and support

### Technology Tools
- **"Share event calendars"** → Digital coordination tools for community activities
- **"Open source TO communities"** → Knowledge and resource sharing platforms for different groups
- **"Your own event map"** → Hyperlocal organizing and discovery tools

## Key Insights

### Holistic Integration
The vision board shows how community cohesion emerges from multiple interconnected elements - from daily relationship-building to structural changes in work and social systems.

### Care Infrastructure
Making care visible and creating non-event-based connections suggests building systems that support ongoing mutual aid rather than just occasional community events.

### Alternative Social Models
The ideas point toward reimagining social gathering (non-alcohol events), work arrangements (4-day week), and neighborhood engagement beyond traditional models.

### Technology as Tool
Digital tools serve the vision of community coordination and knowledge sharing rather than replacing in-person connection.

## Questions for Further Exploration
1. How do we design "non-event based connections" in existing neighborhoods?
2. What would it look like to make acts of care more visible and valued?
3. How could a 4-day work week support stronger community networks?
4. What digital tools would best serve hyperlocal community organizing?
