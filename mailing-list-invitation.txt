Subject: 💙 Come with your idea. Leave with a team. | Cohesion Summit Sept 5

Hey Toronto community builders! 

Ever feel like you're the only one dreaming about bringing people together? 

You're not. And we're about to prove it. ✨

Join us for an evening where solo dreamers become collaborative teams. Where your "what if we could..." meets someone else's "I know how to..." 

🗓️ September 5, 2025 | 6-9 PM | CSI Spadina

Here's how it works:
🎯 6:00 PM - Speed-meeting icebreakers (practice your pitch!)
🤝 6:45 PM - Form teams around shared dreams
🎤 7:15 PM - Pitch together & find your people
🍻 8:45 PM - Continue at the bar :)

Whether you're building apps, organizing events, or just have wild ideas about human connection—this is where you find your co-conspirators.

Because when mission-aligned people work together? Magic happens. 🚀

Limited to 225 dreamers & doers. Tickets required.
